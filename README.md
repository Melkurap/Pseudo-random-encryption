# Pseudo-random-encryption
This project is about possibility to encrypt a piece of sentences. In this is used pseudo-random encryption. So we enter a sample sentence, and each letter is encoded by random-choosed letter with english alphabet. So this encryption is similar to Caesar cipher, but in this project, the encryption process is pseudo-random.
